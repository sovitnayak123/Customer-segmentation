## Introduction
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into distinct groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It helps businesses tailor their marketing efforts and services to different segments, improving customer satisfaction and business efficiency. In this project, we use K-means clustering to segment customers from the Mall Customers dataset based on their age, annual income, and spending score.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Mall Customers dataset, which contains the following columns:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

The dataset is included in this repository as `Mall_Customers.csv`.

## Installation
To run the analysis, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd customer-segmentation
```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "customer segmentation.ipynb"
```
4. Run the cells in the notebook to perform the customer segmentation analysis.

## Results
The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Loads and explores the dataset.
2. Preprocesses the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. Applies the K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups.
4. Visualizes the clusters using 2D and 3D plots.

The final output includes visualizations of customer segments based on their age, annual income, and spending score.
